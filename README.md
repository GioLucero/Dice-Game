# Dice-Game

This app was created in Swift.

This was a an app challenge provided by Angela Yu on her iOS Udemy course.

In this tutorial, I learned to nagivate Xcode, and connected objects from the interface builder to the code. Also, I implemented functions and variables to create a randomizer for the images within the app. 

The app generates a new dice images when the roll button is pressed, or if the device is shaken.
